# Creating contour plots for request execution times and number of nodes
1. Fill in all data in this [sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16DhgOet618eIkfmh_xAYO248aq0EQtNouWlL9BVotjY/edit#gid=1583175151)
2. Download the sheet as a `csv`-file
3. Rename it to `data.csv`
4. Replace all `,` (commas) with `.` (dots)
5. Put the `csv`-file in the same folder as the `countour_plot.m`-file and run the script! Infinite profit.
